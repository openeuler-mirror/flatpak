Subject: [PATCH] context: Implement MODE_NONE in unparse_filesystem_flags
flatpak doesn't yet use -Wswitch-enum, but perhaps it should at some
point. Now that FLATPAK_FILESYSTEM_MODE_NONE is a member of the enum,
it should be handled; and if we're doing that, we might as well make
the same function fully responsible for it.
